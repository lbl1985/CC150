// 3.7 An animal shelter holds only dogs and cats, and operates on a strictly "first in, first
// out" basis. People must dopt either the "oldest" (based on arrival time) of all animals
// at the shelter, or they can select whether they would prefer a dog or a cat (and will
// receive the oldest animal of that type). They canno select which specific animal they
// would like. Create the data structures to maintain this system and implement ooperattions 
// such as enqueue, dequeueAny, dequeueDog and dequeueCat. You may use the built-in 
// LinkedList data structure.
