// 3.3 Imagine a (literal) stack of plates. If the stack gets too high, it might topple.
// Therefore, in rel life, we would likely start a new stack when the previous stack
// exceeds some threshold. Implement a data structure SetofStacks that mimics 
// this. SetOfStacks should be composed of serveral stcks and should create a
// new stack once the previoius one exceds capacity. SetOfStacks.push() and 
// SetOfStacks.pop() should behave identically to a single stack (that is, pop()
// should return the same values as it would if therer were just a single stack).
// FOLLOW UP
// Implement a function popat(int index) which perform a pop operation on
// a specific sub-stack
