// 4.8 You have two very large binary trees: T1, with millions of nodes, and T2, with
// hundreds of nodes. Create an algorithm to decide if T2 is a subtree of T1.
// A tree T2 is a subtree of T1 if threre exists a node n in T1 such that the subtree of 
// n is identical to T2. That is, if you cut off the tree at node n, the two trees would
// be identical.
